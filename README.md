# A custom GPA calculator for Northwestern students

This script takes in a plaintext version of your unofficial transcript from
CAESAR and calculates your GPA using only classes that you select.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure Python (2.7) is installed on your system.

2. Copy and paste your unofficial transcript from CAESAR into transcript.txt

3. Download gpa_calc.py and place it in the same directory as trascript.txt

4. Currently the program depends on the northwestern course data api
   (http://developer.asg.northwestern.edu/), but that dependency will be
   removed shortly.

5. Run the script

    $ python gpa_calc.py
